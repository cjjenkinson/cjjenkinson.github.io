          Hi there Iâ€™m Cameron. Iâ€™m a programmer and maker based in the United Kingdom. 
          I currently work at Learnerbly where I work with a group of engineers building cloud based serverless applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of this I work on products and share things that I built along the way as open source projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started my journey in tech at the sweet age of 10 when I tried to put together a gaming PC so 
          I could play Command & Conquer in higher definition. Next was at the University of Southampton 
          where I studied computer science. I had a guest lecture with Tim Bernes-lee in my first week and it was magic. 
          I think thatâ€™s the only reason I went there because I switched from computer science to business management 
          one year later because I thought it would make starting a successful startup easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent the rest of my time at University making house music as South Royston travelling across 
          the country and Europe performing at venues. It was a lot of fun. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I got super into Hackathons back when they were the cool 48 hour build a real start-up with 
          random people like launch48 and start-up weekend. This got me really into product development and 
          engineering where I found my groove as a front-end UI engineer in the early stages of my career after I graduated.
        </p> 

        <p>
          I launched my first product in 2015 it was a music discovery app for professional DJs. Ever since then
          Iâ€™ve progressed in this field of product development working at start-ups mostly. I really enjoy working
          at start-ups and I did try the corporate world for one year at Accenture but I didnâ€™t like it.
        </p>  

        <p>
          These days I like to keep my life relatively simple and contained. Iâ€™ve always been a creative and maker type person. 
          I never aligned with the archetype of a pure software engineer as Iâ€™m not interested in the low level details, 
          algorithms and complex math in the programming world. I like to build stuff, create things and solve problems with 
          reliable technology. That is why I describe myself as a product engineer.
        </p> 

        <p>
          The writing on here contains my thoughts, experiences and my best answers to questions that developers working with 
          cloud based serverless applications struggle with.
