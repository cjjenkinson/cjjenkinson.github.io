          Hi there Iâ€™m Cameron. Iâ€™m a programmer and maker based in the United Kingdom. 
          I currently work at Learnerbly where I work with a group of engineers building cloud based serverless applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of this I work on products and share things that I built along the way as open source projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started my journey in tech at the sweet age of 10 when I tried to put together a gaming PC so 
          I could play Command & Conquer in higher definition. Next was at the University of Southampton 
          where I studied computer science. I then spent the rest of my time at University making house 
          music as South Royston travelling across the country and Europe performing at venues, it was a lot of fun. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I got into product developmentand  my groove as a front-end UI engineer at the early stages of my career after 
          I graduated from attending Hackathons like launch48 and start-up weekend.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
          I like to build stuff, create things and solve problems with reliable technology. That is why I describe myself as a product engineer.
        </p> 
  
         <p>
          I launched my first product in 2015, a music discovery app for professional DJs. Ever since then
          Iâ€™ve progressed in product development to full-stack development working mostly at start-ups.
        </p>  

        <p>
          The writing on here contains my thoughts, experiences and my best answers to questions that developers working with 
          cloud based serverless applications struggle with.
