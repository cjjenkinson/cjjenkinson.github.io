No Network States should be considered with equal importance alongside Empty UI
States for network critical mobile apps.

<span class="figcaption_hack">Feedly & Grabble no network states</span>

I’m often using apps the most when travelling and it always irritates me when I
lose signal causing apps to throw the “no network” alert and sometimes
preventing me from completing the task I was carrying out.

This occurs the most when I’m on the train, underground, in the country side or
just dealing with intermittent downtime from my network provider.

This led me to start thinking about how designers are handling this situation
and whether this is an area of product design that deserves more attention and
care. Any method of retaining and improving user engagement is important and
this state often interrupts that preventing him or her from continuing the task
at hand or leading the user to exit out of the app.

To date I’ve not seen much around the area of designing for network loss or *No
Network States.*

*“**Delight users through engaging and action orientated Empty states**” — empty
UI state purpose*

What about ways of delighting users through engaging and action orientated *No
Network States* which occurs much more frequently than designers may realise.

I refer to *No Network States* as the UI state in which the users network
connection is** lost** or **interrupted** causing the normal and desired user
experience to be **impacted** or **unusable**.

Currently there is a mix of apps that handle this situation in different ways,
some apps allow for continued use and interaction with a visible notification of
a network loss whilst other apps I’ve used stop any further use of the app until
connection is regained. I believe there should be more conscious decisions and
care around ways to handle this state to maximise user engagement and continue
the experience.

Firstly, I appreciate that from a technical point of view a lack of network
connection for some apps can be difficult to handle and I also respect that
there are currently methods used for these situations such as offline caching.
However, from a designers point of view it’s our responsibility to be mindful of
how this state is handled and work on ideas to maximise engagement.

Below are a few methods I’ve been investigating to extend the no network state
beyond the required alert *“no internet connection”* which I hope will enable
further research and contribution from other designers on it.

#### Three categories:

**Collection — capturing data from the user**

**Engaging — continuing to engage the user within context**

**Informing — letting the user know of any important information**

*****

### Collection Approaches

<span class="figcaption_hack">Basic collection example</span>

Collection is all about collecting **data** from users for whatever purpose is
relevant and valuable to your business. The example above includes a super basic
variation of the common alert message shown to users when the network is lost.
This slight variation extends the message to ask the user to answer a question
which could be a short survey about their experience or the exact feature they
were using when the network connection was lost.

The goal of collection approaches is to **collect valuable data** from users
within the moment they are interrupted *(with the best intentions for the user)*
whilst the connection has chance to regain.

Other collection approaches include: **surveys, questionnaires, ratings, sending
feedback** or **localising the data** for the feature the user was using when he
or she was interrupted.

### Engagement Approaches

<span class="figcaption_hack">Engagement example: play a game with your trendy AI bot</span>

This example includes a simple game that can be played whilst the user waits to
regain connection. Although the example above may not come accross as formal
this method can help **sustain** the user within the app whilst they are
**waiting** to regain connection. This method is purely focused on letting the
user continue to **engage** with your brand or perhaps your new AI bot before
being dropped back into the task they were trying to complete.

The goal of engagement approaches is to sustain users within the app for as long
as possible whilst the connection has chance to regain.

Other engagement methods include: **games, visual loading states **(think iTunes
visualiser)**, video **and** ****permitting local functionality**** (Letting
users scroll through a feed for instance e.g instagram).**

*****

### Informing Approaches

The inform example above is all around **providing information** to users with
respect to the context of your product. Above shows a few company announcements
where they would be triggered to present the user with information upon network
loss.

The goal of informing approaches is to simply **inform** the user of information
they have not yet be made aware of, read or engaged with. This can also be
extended with an outbound and return approach such as to send a push
notification to the user about the unfinished task they left when their
connection was lost.

Other informing examples include:** company messages, feature updates,
announcements, unread user messages **and** push notifications **(“hey, your
connection is back please resume the task you just left”)

I believe there is much more to this than what I’ve suggest above but these may
be the first steps in further research.
