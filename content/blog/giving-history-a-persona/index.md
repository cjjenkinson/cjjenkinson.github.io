## Hisona

The purpose of Hisona was to make learning about history and culture more fun. 

I did this by building a prototype that would bring historical artefacts to 'life' as a conversational learning experience using NLP.

Hisona enabled users to start a conversation with â€˜hisonified' artefacts like public statues, landmarks, monuments, art pieces and museum collections. 

Users can ask open questions to learn more about them from curated knowledge by experts and verified sources like Wikipedia. The point of using NLP was to make it feel like people were chatting with the artefact as some sort of simulated avatar where they can own their learning journey in a more personalised way.

### Demo

It will make more sense if you watch me performing a demo of Hisona at a meet-up
