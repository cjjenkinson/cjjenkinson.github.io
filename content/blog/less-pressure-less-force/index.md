Every year, I've always been someone who has tried to follow the most productive way of working. I have to do lists, notebooks, journals that are filled with thoughts, ideas and priorities. 

I always encourage myself to try out new productivity systems but towards the end of 2020 I started to feel like none of these things were really working or sticking. 

What I realised is that I was applying so much pressure and force to my life to become someone to be successful, to create something that I was rarely taking the time to actually look at what I was creating and how I was making decisions. 

Everything during my day felt very reactive. I would read an article and add it straight to my to do list as a thing to read later and action. I would see a course and add it straight to my to do list to start, any idea that came up, I would add it straight to my to do list. I almost saw my to do list as this secondary brain, a repository of everything that has come up throughout the day. It began to become a lot, it started to build into this mammoth like feeling of pressure and force to be, do and act a particular way as prescribed by what I put into my to do list.

What I noticed is that the to do list was just a never ending flow of nothing.

Te idea of less pressure and less force comes from the fact that I was applying so much pressure and force to myself every day to be productive to create something that I rarely took the time to actually give myself the space to think creatively and make decisions from my intuition.

My theme for 2021 is less pressure and less force. And that starts with removing the to do list. Now I still have a to ‘do list’ for my life admin chores, things that I really need to do like book my car in for a service or get my passport renewed. These things I always need to keep track of, but it's all the things in between. 

All of the noise around my creative work such as reading this, finish this course, design this, code that, all these things were getting in the way of allowing myself to actually have the space to think about what I'm actually creating in order to think about what is the priority in that moment. 

So that's the first point. Living life from a never ending to do list is not really living a life. And I've found that living life from a never ending to do list creates a lot of pressure and force that at some point just builds up into something negative, such as feeling like nothing you do will ever be enough.

I'm now trying to live life with less pressure and less force which means living life without a to do list. To say it's been uncomfortable would be an understatement. But to say it's been an absolute breath of fresh air would be true.I feel a lot more confident about how I approach my days now. I still have a to do list like I mentioned but it's just not how I run my day. I don't live from it anymore.

Now I don't want people to read this and think that I'm not organised, I still follow a calendar, I still have a to do list but it's more of a place where I keep things that I absolutely must do. I try and avoid putting things that relate to the creative work.

The core idea of what I’m sharing here is a way of thinking about how to approach priorities. Instead of it living from a repository of everything possible, create a more expansive space in yourself to allow more creative and divergent thinking. 

Living from a set of priorities has led to some much more creative ideas and much more divergent thinking about what I'm actually doing, what could be done next, what's important right now and what's needed right now. I already feel like my life has less pressure and less force around it, which is great.

My next point is about trusting and using intuition to drive decision making.

When I lived from a to do list, it was very much about adding everything possible that came up from my mind throughout the day, literally anything, anything I read anything that I through about, anything I needed to do would be put on there. 

Now sometimes these things had to be done. Like I said, booking my car for service, getting my passport renewed. These things I need to do, but when it comes to the creative work, I really want to allow my intuition to drive the decision making in that moment based on what is the highest priority.

Now I always have some high level goals of where I want my projects to be heading towards. And I think trusting those goals and then trusting yourself to make the right decisions is what leads to more intuitive based decision making. 

It leads to making more decisions from the heart in that moment. And that feels a lot more expansive. It feels like living with less pressure and less force.

It's really working for me so far, I find that my projects are moving faster, and they're moving with more ease. They're moving in a more streamlined way, when I'm not trying to do everything at once but only trying to do the most important things in that moment.

I think it's important to trust that you'll always know what is the most important thing to do in any given moment and to just allow that to come through for you.

The last point is that I'm actually now using a simpler to do list system, post it notes. They work really well. I start my day by writing out three to four, perhaps at the maximum six post it notes, and I just try and get through them.

Having something that I can touch and feel has been really useful, because I'm able to actually see visibly all the time next to my laptop on the right hand side of my desk what I need to do. That means that I'm less reactive, and less living from a to do list that's constantly updated by the things that I might need to do at some point. 

I really suggest you try this. It's actually a very refreshing way of doing productivity that isn't so tech heavy.

To summarise: this year is about living with less pressure and less force against me. It's not about doing less, but it's about doing less from a chaotic mess.
